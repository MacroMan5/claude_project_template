        return {
            'linting_errors': run_linter_analysis(),
            'type_coverage': calculate_type_coverage(),
            'complexity_score': analyze_code_complexity(),
            'duplication_ratio': detect_code_duplication()
        }

            'redundant_files': identify_test_redundancy()
        }
    
    def assess_project_organization(self):
        """Assess project management health."""
        return {
            'issue_labeling_compliance': audit_issue_labels(),
            'documentation_freshness': check_doc_currency(),

    weights = {
        'code_quality': 0.3,
        'testing': 0.3,
        'project_management': 0.2,
        'infrastructure': 0.2
    }
    
    scores = {}
    for dimension, weight in weights.items():
        dimension_score = calculate_dimension_score(assessments[dimension])
        scores[dimension] = dimension_score
    
    overall_score = sum(score * weights[dim] for dim, score in scores.items())
    
    return {
        'overall_score': overall_score,
        'dimension_scores': scores,
        'recommendations': generate_recommendations(scores)

### **Health-Based Decision Making**
```yaml
Decision Framework:
  High Health (>80):
    - Focus on feature development
    - Maintain current quality standards
    - Consider advanced optimizations
    
  Medium Health (60-80):
    - Balance features with health improvements
    - Address specific health issues
    - Implement preventive measures
    
  Low Health (<60):
    - Prioritize health improvements
    - Pause non-critical feature work
    - Implement intensive improvement plan
